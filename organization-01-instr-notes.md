## Activity 01 - Setting up a new project

**Time required**: 30 minutes

Now that they have seen the best practices slides, the students will apply these
lessons to set up a new project. This activity should reinforce the idea that it
is much easier to set things up right from the start, rather than cleaning up
messes at a future date. It is meant to get the learners thinking about
file names, file organization, and file content and what these can tell us about
a project.   

Point the students to the slides for reference, as well as the two example projects, in the *Resources* section. Have them work in pairs to set up a new project in a way that facilitates reproducibility. Let the students come up with the project themselves, rather than providing sample ecology / genomics / social science / etc projects. 

Put the Exercise and Questions on the screen.

Give them about 20 minutes.

**Discussion**:
  * how did your structure differ from the resources?
  * why did you make changes?
  * what did you and your partner agree / disagree on?
  * were there aspects of the best practices that were difficult to apply to your project?
